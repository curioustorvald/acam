<li>The GUI</li>
<li>Ambient Mixing</li>
</ul>

<h4>What does not work:</h4>

<ul>
<li>AdobeRGB colour model</li>
<li>Variance</li>

<!-- <p>This webapp implements my theory about the <em>Artistic Colour Appearance Model</em>.</p> -->

<!-- <p>It is a common tip in the art community that when you use HSV colour model for your colour picker, vary the H-slider as you darken the colour, which is in part an empirical trick to compensate the error from the natural shading (as observed in CIELAB colour space) to the RGB colour model, also in part, well, it just makes your art look more vibrant. The <em>ACAM</em> (pronounced /'æɪ.kæm/) generalises the idea using the single parameter <em>Variance</em> over the <a href="https://www.hsluv.org/">HSLvu</a> colour space.</p> -->
