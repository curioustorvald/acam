<p>This webapp implements my theory about the <em>Artistic Colour Appearance Model</em>.</p>

<p>It is a common tip in the art community that when you use HSV colour model for your colour picker, vary the H-slider as you darken the colour to make it look more vibrant. The <em>ACAM</em> (pronounced /'æɪ.kæm/) generalises the idea using the single parameter <em>Variance</em> over the LCh<sub>UV</sub> colour space.</p>

<h4>How to Use</h4>

<p>Before you start, select the right RGB Model. If you don’t know what RGB Model is, simply select the sRGB; if you’re using Apple devices, select Display P3.</p>

<p>First, select the <em>Eigencolour</em>. The Eigencolour is the true colour of the object.</p>

<p>Second, adjust the Variance slider so that the colour gradient look vibrant enough.</p>

<p>Third, select the <em>Ambient Colour</em>. The Ambient Colour is the colour of the ambient light. Also adjust the <em>Ambient Mix</em> as you need.</p>

<p>Last, pick the desired colour by simply clicking and dragging on the gradient square. The Hex Code can be copied by clicking on the Selected Colour swatch.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<ul>
<li>Selected Colour Circle is offsetted from where I’ve touched!<br />☞&emsp;Simply refresh the browser.</li>

<li>Selected Colour’s Hex Code is Red!<br />☞&emsp;Red text means the colour is out of gamut of the selected RGB Model. This is mostly harmless; it just means the selected colour can’t be represented accurately due to the limit of the RGB itself. Again, this is harmless.</li>
</ul>
