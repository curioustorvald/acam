<p>This webapp implements the <em>Artistic Colour Appearance Model</em>.</p>

<p>It is a standard in the art community that when you use the HSV colour model for your colour picker, you adjust the H-slider as you darken the colour to make it look more vibrant. The <em>ACAM</em> (pronounced /'æɪ.kæm/) generalises the idea using the single parameter <em>Variance</em> over the <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">OKLab</a> colour space.</p>

<p>Read more about the <em>ACAM</em> <a href="https://curioustorvald.github.io/techtales/index.html?a=cg_202210230111_acam1">here!</a></p>

<h4>How to Use</h4>

<p>Before you start, select the right RGB Model. If you do not know what the RGB Model is, select the sRGB; if you are using an Apple device, select the Display P3.</p>

<p>First, select the <em>Eigencolour</em>. The Eigencolour is the true colour of the object.</p>

<p>Second, select the <em>Highlight Colour</em> and adjust the <em>Highlight Mix</em> as needed.</p>

<p>Third, adjust the <em>Variance</em> slider so the colour gradient looks vibrant enough.</p>

<p>Last, pick the desired colour by simply clicking and dragging on the gradient square. The Hex Code can be copied by clicking on the Selected Colour swatch.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<ul>
<li>The selected Colour Circle is off from where I have touched!<br />☞&emsp;Simply refresh the browser.</li>

<li>Selected Colour’s Hex Code is Red!<br />☞&emsp;Red text means the colour is out of the gamut of the selected RGB Model. This is mostly harmless; it just means the selected colour cannot be represented accurately due to the limit of the RGB itself. Again, this is harmless.</li>
</ul>
